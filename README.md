## About
### Prism is an augmented reality heads up display on a pair of glasses. It is capable of hand tracking, gesture recognition, facial recognition, and control over devices connected through the internet.
The glasses were built using microdisplays and optics salvaged from broken video glasses, a stripped-down webcam, wifi module, and python code running on a Raspberry Pi for face recognition, hand tracking, and taking pictures.
It is able to detect swipe motions and other hand gestures through the computer vision code here. Prism detects nodding and shaking of the head via optical flow detection though the webcam.
To be added is a fully designed single board computer around the Allwinner A13 SoC, with onboard wifi, accelerometer/gyro, and interfaces for the display and camera.
